# Airdrop FAQ

### How do I claim the airdrop?

* Visit [https://app.stargaze.zone/airdrop](https://app.stargaze.zone/airdrop) and complete the missions.

### How can I earn yield with STARS?

* There’s two ways to earn yield with STARS:
  * **Staking**
    * Delegate a single asset (STARS) to validators
  * **Bonding liquidity on Osmosis**
    * Provide liquidity with two assets (STARS + OSMO, or STARS + ATOM), and bond LP tokens.
*   What are the APRs for staking and providing liquidity (LP’ing)?

    * All APRs are listed on the airdrop claim site at: [https://app.stargaze.zone/airdrop](https://app.stargaze.zone/airdrop).

    💡 NOTE: The Osmosis website only lists OSMO incentives and \*\*\*does not\*\*\* include STARS incentives.

### How does staking work?

* Staking locks up STARS with a validator, earning rewards for the locked period. This is also called “delegating”.
* You only need one asset (STARS) to stake.
* Unstaking (also called undelegating) has a 14-day unbonding period where no rewards are earned.
* Do your own research (DYOR) on which validator(s) to delegate to.
* Where do I stake?
  * Desktop
    * Stargaze website: [https://stake.stargaze.zone/stake](https://stake.stargaze.zone/stake) (zero gas)
    * Keplr website: [https://wallet.keplr.app/#/stargaze/stake](https://wallet.keplr.app/#/stargaze/stake)
    * [Ping.pub](http://ping.pub) website: [https://ping.pub/stargaze](https://ping.pub/stargaze)
  * Mobile
    * Keplr mobile apps: [https://www.keplr.app](https://www.keplr.app)
    * Cosmostation: [https://wallet.cosmostation.io/stargaze](https://wallet.cosmostation.io/stargaze)
*   Risks: Slashing

    💡 Validators you are staking with can go offline. When this happens they get “slashed”. A portion of your staked assets also get slashed when a validator get slashed. You can always re-delegate your tokens to another validator.

### How do I transfer STARS to Osmosis?

* Go to the **Assets** tab on Osmosis at [https://app.osmosis.zone/assets](https://app.osmosis.zone/assets).
* Click **Deposit** next to Stargaze - STARS

### How do Osmosis liquidity incentives work?

* Osmosis has liquidity incentives in both OSMO and STARS
* STARS incentives were provided by the Stargaze community pool (DAO), and end on April 13th, 2022.
* To earn incentives, you have to:
  * Add liquidity to the [STARS/OSMO pool](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/604), or the [ATOM/STARS pool](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/611)
  *   Bond your resulting LP tokens with a 1-day, 7-day, or 14-day unbonding period. This means there’s a 1, 7, or 14 day time period to fully unbond where you earn reduced rewards.

      This diagram explains the reduced rewards during the unbonding period:
* OSMO and STARS incentives are distributed once a day at 12:15pm ET. They will show up in your Assets tab.
* Risks: Impermanent loss

{% hint style="info" %}
Impermanent loss happens when one asset in the pool is more volatile than the other. Please watch this video for a full explanation: [https://youtu.be/\_m6Mowq3Ptk](https://youtu.be/\_m6Mowq3Ptk).
