# CosmWasm Smart Contracts

Stargaze runs community-governed CosmWasm. All this means is that custom smart contracts have to be uploaded via governance.

### Why community-governed CosmWasm?

Because Stargaze has zero gas, smart contracts have to be designed to not exceed compute or storage limits.&#x20;

Without going through governance, it would be easy to upload a malicious contract that exploits having zero gas (such as a state bloat attack). By going through governance, custom contracts can be reviewed by the community and core team.

### How do I write a contract that works with Stargaze?

1. Write your contract, deploy it on [testnet](https://testnet.publicawesome.dev/marketplace), and make sure it works as intended.
2. If the contract charges any fees, be sure to take advantage of Stargazeâ€™s Developer Royalties. Developer Royalties enable developers to earn 50% of all fees that go through their custom contracts.
3. Submit a [Commonwealth](https://gov.stargaze.zone) post, explaining what your contract does, with a link to the source code. Smart contracts on Stargaze are required to be open source. Non-contract code such as frontend and backend may be private.
4. Contact the Core Team for a review and audit of your code.
5. After validating the project with the community and team, submit a governance proposal with the contract code. See the following command to submit your proposal: `starsd tx gov submit-proposal wasm-store -h`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Join [Discord](https://discord.gg/stargaze) for more information on deploying on testnet. The testnet is completely permissionless. A faucet is also available in Discord.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Developer Royalties cannot be combined with bounties or Community Pool funding. For example, if you receive Community Pool funding for your contract, it cannot also receive Developer Royalties.
{% endhint %}

### How do I deploy to Stargaze mainnet?

Stargaze is a permissioned chain, meaning there is a governance process to adhere to. After familiarizing yourself with the [governance process](../governance/protocol-governance "mention"), here's a template to follow for submitting an on-chain proposal.

To submit a governance proposal via the `starsd` CLI, you may follow the example below.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't have `starsd` on your machine, please follow [these instructions](../nodes-and-validators/getting-setup "mention").
{% endhint %}

```shell
title="Smart contract you're proposing"
desc=$(cat desc.md | jq -Rsa | tr -d '"')
deposit="50000000000ustars"

starsd tx gov submit-proposal wasm-store your_contract_binary.wasm \
    --title "$title" \
    --description "$desc" \
    --deposit $deposit \
    --run-as $CREATOR \
    --from $PROPOSER \
    --gas 30000000 \
    --gas-prices 1ustars \
    --instantiate-anyof-addresses <stars addresses comma-separated> -y
```

**Note**: the `--instantiate-anyof-addresses` flags is particularly important, as it denotes which address or addresses are allowed to instantiate the stored code. This will likely be an EOA and a multisig, or something similar. It may be helpful to read the descriptions of all the flags by running: `starsd tx gov submit-proposal wasm-store --help`.
