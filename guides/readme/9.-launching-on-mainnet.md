# 9. Launching on mainnet

You have thoroughly tested your contracts on testnet. The images and metadata reside on IPFS. You only need to change some values in `config.js` before launching on mainnet.&#x20;

* Change ACCOUNT INFO [i.e. `mnemonic` and public address `address`] to your mainnet account.
* Comment out testnet `rpcEndpoint`: `//rpcEndpoint: 'https://rpc.elgafar-1.stargaze-apis.com/'`
* Uncomment mainnet `rpcEndpoint`: `rpcEndpoint: 'https://rpc.stargaze-apis.com/'`
* Ensure `royaltyPaymentAddress` is updated to reflect a mainnet public address
* Change `startTime` of the launch. i.e: 3pm EST on Friday, March 25, 2022, and format it to UTC (https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/zulu): `startTime: '2022-03-25T19:00:00.000Z'`.
* Comment out (add `//` before all the contract codes)`CONTRACT CODE IDs: Castor Testnet`&#x20;
* Uncomment (remove `//` before the contract codes sg721CodeId, minterCodeId, whitelistCodeId) `CONTRACT CODE IDs: Mainnet`&#x20;

Now you're ready to deploy.

To instantiate the contract on mainnet:
```bash
yarn minter
```
To verify your NFT collection successfully launched, take your new `minter` address and enter it at https://app.stargaze.zone/launchpad/. For example, https://app.stargaze.zone/launchpad/stars1vhu3a6pkftf2g58622zujmq3sdptz6rmd3sgcdh4upmfhfzrcdzs5mgujh. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Whitelist `start_time` and `end_time` should come before Public Mint `start_time`. Airdrops can be done irrespective of any `start_time`.\
\
Ex: You launch your minter contract to mainnet on 12/24/2022 with Whitelist starting on Christmas (12/25/2022) and Public Mint the day after (12/26/2022). You can airdrop on Christmas Eve (12/24/2022) or Christmas (12/25/2022) or during Public Mint. **With great power comes great responsibility**.
{% endhint %}

At any time, before whitelist, during whitelist sale, or during public sale you are able to use `mint_to(address)` or `mint_for(token_id, address)` to do airdrops. If the special airdrop tokens are  early token ids (i.e: 1, 2, 3, etc), then you want to deploy your contract early and give yourself enough time to run the airdrop and check the results.

Congratulations, you're officially a Stargaze Creator.
