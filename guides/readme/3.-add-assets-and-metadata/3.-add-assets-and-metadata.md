# NFT.storage (script)

In this guide, we will be using [NFT.storage](https://nft.storage) (which works with IPFS) and an upload script.

## Get NFT Storage API Key

Sign up for [NFT.storage](https://nft.storage), and head to the [API keys section](https://nft.storage/manage/). Select the "New Key" button.

![Create a new API key](../../../.gitbook/assets/newKey.jpg)

Give the new API key a name...

Finally, click "Create" to generate a new API key. This will take you to a page listing the key.\
\
Simply press the "Copy" button to copy it for use in the next section.

## Setup Config

Open your `config.js` file in your favorite text editor and add the corresponding API key to the `nftStorageApiKey` field. For example:

```
// NFT.storage endpoint
  nftStorageEndpoint: 'https://api.nft.storage',
  // NFT.storage API key
  nftStorageApiKey: '<PUT_YOUR_KEY_HERE>',
```

You can leave `nftStorageEndpoint` as `https://api.nft.storage`.

Make sure the rest of `config.js` is filled out according to your project needs. It's particularly important to note the _Collection Info_ section. This information will be used for generating metadata about your collection, and will control how it is displayed in the UI.

```
  //// COLLECTION INFO ////
  // The name of your collection
  name: 'Collection Name',
  // The 3-7 letter ticker symbol for your collection
  symbol: 'SYM',
  // Project description
  description: 'An awesome NFT series',
  // Path to image to use as the main image for the collection
  image: 'images/1.png',
  // The URI containing JSON metadata about your contract
  // Please follow: https://docs.opensea.io/docs/contract-level-metadata
  contractUri: 'ipfs://QmaW9axXgCL7nNMBMWPA2hYgqZFJZ4JQ5nmgeFNnrACJC5',
```

{% hint style="info" %}
NOTE: `image` here in the _Collection Info_ config is the image that is used when your collection is displayed in the UI. The `nft-storage-upload` script will upload this image to IPFS for you.
{% endhint %}

After filling out your config, and double checking all the details, you're now ready to upload your project to IPFS! Simply run:

```
yarn run nft-storage-upload
```

This will output a `baseTokenUri`. Be sure to add it to your `config.js` file.

With your assets uploaded to IPFS, you are now ready to instantiate your smart contracts.
