# 1. Setup a basic project

## Initialize a new project

Setting up your project for minting is done via a set of command-line tools. Start by cloning a sample repository, and replace it with your project contents.

Replace `[my-project-name]` with the name of your project.

```
git clone https://github.com/public-awesome/stargaze-tools [my-project-name]
cd [my-project-name]
yarn install
```

## Create a testnet account

In order to deploy a smart contract on Stargaze, you'll need an account with some STARS in it. For this tutorial, we will be instantiating our smart contract on the Stargaze testnet, Big Bang.&#x20;

```
yarn account
```

You should see mnemonic and address printed out like:

```
>> mnemonic: sure adapt throw vocal sibling mom already light dinner sail survey sphere
pubkey: {
  type: 'tendermint/PubKeySecp256k1',
  value: 'AwqXZKoqAJl+9R3qWgseVYomxFN2akDGQ2rzS6P/Oyfo'
}
address: stars1us0r08kr3jtr0h74skk46hl6cmtsrptlqyfstl
✨  Done in 1.03s.
```

Now edit `config.js` and fill in the above mnemonic and address in their corresponding fields.
