# 4. Instantiate sale contract on testnet

On Stargaze, you can instantiate contracts code that have already been uploaded to the chain. Since a basic NFT sale contract already exists on Stargaze, you can just make a new instance of it with your project's data that's in `config.json`.

Create an instance of this contract code on the blockchain with:

```
yarn run init.ts
```

If all went well, you should see a print out of your minter contract address. Edit `config.json` and fill in this address for `minter`. It will be used be used in the next section to mint from your contract.

Congratulations! You have completed the first step in launching your collection.
