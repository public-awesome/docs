description: Creating Pools

# How it works

Each pool is created by the holder or buyer of a specific collection. There can be multiple pools for the same collection, and you can create as many pools as you want. There is a small fee that must be paid when creating a pool.

When creating a pool, you will be presented with the following options:

* A pool with STARS (for buying NFTs)
* A pool with NFTs (for selling)
* A pool with both NFTs and STARS (for both buying and selling NFTs).

You can then select the NFT collection to pair with the STARS token.

The final step is to set the pool parameters:

* The number of STARS tokens to deposit into the pool.
* The specific NFTs from the selected collection that you would like to deposit into the pool.
* The swap fee, which is the amount of STARS you will earn on every transaction (only applicable for 'buy and sell' pools).
* The bonding curve (linear, exponential, or XYK). This is the algorithm used to determine pool prices.
* The spot price, which is the starting pool price (only applicable for linear and exponential pools).
* The delta, which is a parameter used to calculate subsequent pool prices (only applicable for linear and exponential pools).
